1) Hierarcical modelling, the windmill
- How can you get all four blades to rotate with just one time-dependent rotation matrix?
    With a rotation matrix around X axis

- How do you make the wings follow the body's movements?
    Rotating each one with the same rotation matrix

2) Manual viewing controls
- What kind of control did you implement?
    Keyboard control
- Can you make this kind of control in some other way than manipulating a "look-at" matrix?
    Moving the models instead of the camera

3) Virtual world and skybox
- How did you handle the camera matrix for the skybox?
    Making a translation matrix with the X and Z elements of the camera vector and a constant as Y element, in our case 2.7
- How did you represent the objects? Is this a good way to manage a scene or would you do it differently for a "real" application?
    I upload a model to world matrix for the skybox and a unique matrix for the rest of the elements. I think is a good way but better more construct with structs and classess
- What special considerations are needed when rendering a skybox?
    That fits all the scene so that yo dont see the background color. Dont see the edges of the images of the cube.
- What is the problem with the skybox object used in the lab? (The problem doesn't have to be corrected.)
    

4) Specular shading, external light sources
- How do you generate a vector from the surface to the eye?
    Substracting the camera vector (where the camera is located) with the position vector of the element
- Which vectors need renormalization in the fragment shader?
    lightSourcesDirPosArr, ex_Normal and the eyeDirection
