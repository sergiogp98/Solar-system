1) Load and inspect the heightmap.
- What kind of data does the heightmap image data hold? What range is the heightmap data?
    Each pixel store values, such as surface elevation data. A heightmap contains one channel interpreted 
    as a distance of displacement or “height” from the “floor”, with black representing minimum height and 
    white representing maximum height.

- The terrain is 4x4. How many polygons does it draw?
    (3x3)x2=18 triangles (code line 44)

2) Navigating the heightmap
- Did you need to extend your camera movement code? How?
    We just use the same method for the camera movement as we implemented in the previous lab. We have used
    the glutKeyIsDown function.
    
3) Calculate normal vectors and apply lighting
- Which method did you use to find the normal vector?
    We picked neighbour vertices method

4) Calculating map height for a point
- How did you figure out what surface to use? 

- How did you calculate the height from the surface?
    I used the plane equation

5) Multitexturing
- What kind of multitexturing function did you implement?
    I applied sin function

6) Pick one of the "extras" below as final part of the lab.
    6c) The lake [easy (with optional hard extensions)]
    - How did you identify the water surface?
        I initialized a global variable in the fragment shader for limiting the Y axis height of a pixel. If it is less than that, a paint it blue
